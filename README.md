# spellcorrector

A C++ spell corrector based on Peter Norvig's algorithm.
English words were preloaded from a text file "big.txt", which contains a collection of books, to create
"english_dictionary.txt". This was to optimize the runtime of the program by avoiding repetitive processing
of "big.txt".
The program must be run with C++17 and should be run with the O3 flag to optimize the runtime performance.
